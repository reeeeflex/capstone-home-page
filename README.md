## Elite Plutus Logistics Landing Page

This is a capstone project from Codecademy, in this project we need to create a responsive landing page for a company. I used my previous companies name and purpose as the insperation (I am previous CEO, no coyright).

## Version 0.1

- Created starter HTML and CSS as well as imported images from unsplash as filler images
- Skeleton of HTML created with correct content
- Base of CSS has been created, working from top to bottom to style the page
- Used as much semantic HTML and responsive values to avoid static looking webpage
- Established first pull to GitHub to provide documentation as I progress with this LP
